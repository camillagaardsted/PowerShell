Open a **Windows PowerShell console** in **admin** mode (right click run as administrator)\n","2. Run the cmdlet **Update-Help** in your PowerShell console. It will download help files and documentation for all PowerShell modules on your machine. It might take some time and you may experience a few errors if some links are dead. \n","3. Now try running **Get-Help about_* ** If you get a long list of about articles you have successfully downloaded the help files in step 2. You are now ready to use the fantastic help features in PowerShell.\n","\n","The next 3 exercises focuses on Get-Help. It is the most important PowerShell cmdlet, because it lets you find cmdlets and it can explain how to use them.\n","The The bold words (fed skrift) in step 1 are hints. They may be part of the name of the cmdlet you are looking for.  \n","\n","\n","## Exercise 2 Information about your machine\n","\n","1. Open the ISE and type a comment in the top of the powershell script pane e.g. # DAY 1 PowerShell Exercise 2 \n","2. Use Get-Help to find the name of a cmdlet which gives you a lot of **info** about your **computer**\n","3. Type the name of the cmdlet you found and hit F1 in the ISE. A floating window with help about the cmdlet should popup.\n","4. Study the syntax and example 1. This tells you that you can run the cmdlet directly without any parameters.\n","5. Run the cmdlet in the ISE (Just use F8 if the cursor is on the line where you typed the cmdlet). You get a long list with a lot of properties with information about your computer.\n","6. Example 2 in the floating window shows you how this cmdlet lets you filter the properties using a wildcard search. Please use the cmdlet again on a new line using the **-property** parameter to show all properties with windows in the name. Make sure you also see OsWindowsDirectory in your output.\n","\n","## Exercise 3 Testing whether a path exists or not\n","\n","1. Use Get-Help to find a cmdlet which can **test** whether a given **path** exists on your disk drives.\n","2. Study the help for the cmdlet. You realize it returns True or False if a folder/file path exists or not.\n","3. Use the cmdlet to check whether you have a C:\\windows\\system32 folder. The result should be true.\n","4. Use the cmdlet again to check whether you have a file called D:\\windows\\system32\\ipconfig.exe\n","\n","\n","## Excercise 4\n","\n","1. In ISE use Get-Help to find a cmdlet which returns **ipaddresses** on your computer. Remember PowerShell cmdlets always use singularis nouns (ental) and Get cmdlets are the ones we use to retrieve information.\n","2. Run the following command in ISE.

Study the Example 1 in the help article in the browser. Type the example code in ISE and notice the editor helps you with the syntax and options for the addressfamily parameter.

Run the cmdlet once more without any parameters. You get both ipv4 and ipv6 now. Identify the name of your ethernet connection.\n","6. Run the cmdlet again for ipv4 family and with the interfacealias parameter and the name you identified in step 5.
