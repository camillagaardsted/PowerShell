Open a **Windows PowerShell console** in **admin** mode (right click run as administrator) directly on the lab hosting machine.\n","2. Run the cmdlet **Update-Help** in your PowerShell console. It will download help files and documentation for all PowerShell modules on your machine. It might take some time and you may experience a few errors if some links are dead. \n","3. Now try running the command Get-Help about_*\n","4. If you get a long list of about articles you have successfully downloaded the help files in step 2. You are now ready to use the fantastic help features in PowerShell.\n","\n","The next 4 exercises focuses on Get-Help. It is the most important PowerShell cmdlet, because it lets you find cmdlets and it can explain how to use them.\n","The bold words (fed skrift) in step 1 or 2 are hints. They may be part of the name of the cmdlet you are looking for.  \n","\n","\n","## Exercise 2 Information about your machine\n","\n","1. Open the ISE and type a comment in the top of the powershell script pane e.g. # DAY 1 PowerShell Course Module 1 Exercise 2 \n","2. Use Get-Help to find the name of a cmdlet which gives you a lot of **info** about your **computer**\n","3. Type the name of the cmdlet you found and hit F1 in the ISE. A floating window with help about the cmdlet should popup.\n","4. Study the syntax and example 1. This tells you that you can run the cmdlet directly without any parameters.\n","5. Run the cmdlet in the ISE (Just use F8 if the cursor is on the line where you typed the cmdlet). You get a long list with a lot of properties with information about your computer. Notice it takes a while for PowerShell to collect all the information.\n","6. Example 2 in the floating window shows you how this cmdlet lets you filter the properties using a wildcard search. Please use the cmdlet again on a new line using the **-property** parameter to show all properties with windows in the name. Make sure you also see the OsWindowsDirectory property in your output.\n","\n","## Exercise 3 Testing whether a path exists or not\n","\n","1. Use Get-Help to find a cmdlet which can **test** whether a given **path** exists on your disk drives.\n","2. Study the help for the cmdlet. You realize it returns True or False if a folder/file path exists or not.\n","3. Use the cmdlet to check whether you have a C:\\windows\\system32 folder. The result should be true.\n","4. Use the cmdlet again to check whether you have a file called D:\\windows\\system32\\ipconfig.exe\n","\n","\n","## Excercise 4\n","\n","1. In ISE use Get-Help to find a cmdlet which returns **ipaddresses** on your computer. Remember PowerShell cmdlets always use singularis nouns (ental) and Get cmdlets are the ones we use to retrieve information.\n","2. Run the following command in ISE. This will open a browser with the help article for your cmdlet from step 1 (If the browser asks you to set the default search engine choose Google and set it as default)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"989375df-b4e4-4224-8a28-3f620da86290","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"},"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"outputs":[],"source":["Get-Help -online #Type the name of your cmdlet from step 1 here instead of this green comment#"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7b8dd52d-f6d1-4baa-a2fd-87347a9fff4d","metadata":{"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"},"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"source":["3. Navigate to the cmdlet examples via the link in the right side of the browser page. Study the Example 1 in the help article in the browser. Type the example 1 code in ISE and notice the editor helps you with the syntax and options for the addressfamily parameter. **Please Do not just copy paste it.** Run the command to get a list of all ipv6 addresses on your computer.\n","4. Write a similar cmdlet on the next line in the ISE to get all ipv4 addresses\n","5. Run the cmdlet once more without any parameters. You get both ipv4 and ipv6 now. Identify the name of your ethernet connection.\n","6. Run the cmdlet again for ipv4 family and with the interfacealias parameter and the name you identified in step 5. The name is a string - remember to use qoutes \"\" around the name if it contains a space (mellemrum).  \n","\n","## Exercise 5 Disabling a scheduled task\n","\n","1. Find a cmdlet which **disables** a **scheduled** **task**.\n","2. You need to disable a scheduled task called XblGameSaveTask. If you try to disable it and only specify the name you get an error.\n","3. Lookup all the scheduled tasks on the machine with another cmdlet. Note the path of the XblGameSaveTask\n","4. Run the cmdlet from step 2 again but this time remember to specify the path for the task. Please be aware that you need admin priviliges in ISE/PowerShell console to disable a scheduled task in Windows. \n","5. Finally check via PowerShell that the scheduled task is disabled.  \n","\n","\n","## Exercise 6 Get-Command\n","\n","1. Our lab environment runs on a Windows Server where the **Hyper-V** role is installed. Roles and features in Windows have their own PowerShell modules, which are not included in a standard PowerShell installation. The relevant PowerShell modules are installed together with the role/feature.

ISE is an old editor but it has an advantage. It is always included in Windows Server and desktop when you have a GUI installation. It cannot run PowerShell 7 scripts.\n"," \n","1. Open a PowerShell console.\n","2. Read the help article about ISE with the command **Get-Help about_windows_powershell_ise** in the console.\n","4. The help article is long. It might be easier to read it one page at a time. You can do this if you just type help without get- like this: **Help about_windows_powershell_ise** Read the last Notes section in the article. \n","5. Type **ise** in your powershell console and hit enter. This will open ISE. You can of course also just open the application from the Windows start menu.\n"]}],"metadata":{"dependencies":{},"kernel_info":{"name":"synapse_pyspark"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Synapse PySpark","language":"Python","name":"synapse_pyspark"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark","ms_spell_check":{"ms_spell_check_language":"en"}},"nteract":{"version":"nteract-front-end@1.0.0"},"spark_compute":{"compute_id":"/trident/default"},"widgets":{}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
