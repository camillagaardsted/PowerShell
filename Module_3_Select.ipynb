Run the PowerShell cmdlet which displays the current date and time\n","2. Display the name of all properties and methods with Get-Member\n","3. Sometimes it is easier just to study the properties directly for an object with Select *. Try that\n","4. Display the name of the day and which number it is in this year\n","5. Create a variable with the date for Christmas this year\n","6. Compute how many days are left before Christmas \n","\n","## Exercise 2 Select some file properties\n","\n","1. List all exe files in the folder C:\\windows\\System32\n","2. Show the size, the filename, when the file was created and last time it was used.\n","3. Show the 5 largest exe files from the list of files in step 2\n","\n","## Exercise 3 Expanding a single property\n","\n","1. Find all the ipaddresses for your machine \n","2. Use the builtin properties on the cmdlet in step 1 to get your ip4 ethernet ipaddress\n","3. Create a variable called $ipAddress and store the value from step 2 in it\n","4. Check the datatype for your $ipAddress variable. It should be a string. Otherwise you need to expand your property in step 3. \n","\n","\n","## Exercise 4 Select properties and calculate a property\n","\n","1. Run the Get-ComputerInfo cmdlet\n","2. Select specific properties which gives the following information: The last time the machine was started, the language for the operating system, the name of the os product\n","3. The OSUpTime tells us how long time the machine has been running. Try to calculate the same value using the not so pretty dictionary syntax for a calculated property.  \n","\n","\n","## Exercise 5 Use the wildcard options\n","\n","1. Find all services with a name which starts with w\n","2. Study the different properties for a service with Get-Member\n","3. Show all properties which starts with s e.g starttype,status, etc for the services from step 1 \n","\n","## Exercise 6 Distinct aliases\n","\n","1. Use a cmdlet to display all the different ipaddresses on your machine\n","2. Show the distinct interface aliases. This means you only want to see each name once \n","\n","## Exercise 7 Skip, index, first and last\n","\n","1. Display all firewall rules on your machine which are enabled.\n","2. Save the names for them in a variable called $firewallRules\n","3. Experiment with the skip, index, first and last parameters for the Select cmdlet.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"f96b85c5-20ec-455a-bf0e-a2f94aeeb9ba"},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"metadata":{"jupyter":{"source_hidden":false,"outputs_hidden":false},"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark"}},"id":"a66a0e93-025e-451f-86d2-1b722aba84f5"}],"metadata":{"kernel_info":{"name":"synapse_pyspark"},"kernelspec":{"name":"synapse_pyspark","display_name":"synapse_pyspark"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"microsoft":{"language":"python","language_group":"synapse_pyspark","ms_spell_check":{"ms_spell_check_language":"en"}},"widgets":{},"nteract":{"version":"nteract-front-end@1.0.0"},"spark_compute":{"compute_id":"/trident/default"},"dependencies":{}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
